      QUESTION: |-
        Could Georgios Koutsias have served on the House of Lords?
      PROPOSED: >-
        Based on General rule 1, Georgios Koutsias, must have been alive during the time the House of Lords existed. Since the House of Lords existed from 1801 to the present, and Georgios Koutsias was born in 2004, this condition is satisfied.
        However, based on General rule 1, Georgios Koutsias must have satisfied the criteria for serving on the House of Lords such as being a citizen of the United Kingdom. Since Georgios Koutsias is a citizen of Greece, not the United Kingdom, this condition is not satisfied.
        In answering this question, I didn't make any assumptions.

        Did Paolo Maldini's wife come from the same country as him?
      PROPOSED: >-
        Based on General rule 1, the birth places of Paolo Maldini and his wife must be located in the same country for the answer to be yes.
        Fact 1 tells us that Paolo Maldini's wife is Adriana Fossa, but it doesn't tell us where she was born.
        We need to know where Adriana Fossa was born to answer this question.

        Did Fakhri Nikzad and Gelareh Abbasi have similar tastes in men?
      PROPOSED: >-
        based on General rule 1, if Fakhri Nikzad and Gelareh Abbasi had relationships with the same men, then we can infer that they had similar tastes in men.
        Based on Fact 5, Fakhri Nikzad was married to Asghar Akbari and based on Fact 9, Gelareh Abbasi was also married to Asghar Akbari.

        Is it likely for Tom Avni to celebrate hanukkah?
      PROPOSED: >-
        based on General rule 1, Tom Avni must be Jewish and celebrate the important Jewish ceremonies for the answer to be yes. Fact 5 tells us that Tom Avni is Jewish.
        Although we don't know if Tom Avni celebrates the important Jewish ceremonies, since it is likely for most Jews to celebrate Jewish ceremonies, we can infer that Tom Avni does
        celebrate hanukkah.
        In answering this question, I assumed that Tom Avni celebrates the important Jewish ceremonies.
