      QUESTION: |-
        Could Aristotle be a member of House of Lords?
        Hints: 1- Aristotle: Classical Greek philosopher and polymath (384-322 BC).
        2- House of Lords: upper house in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
        General rules: 1- Aristotle must have been alive at the time House of Lords was established or in existence to be able to be member of it.
        Facts: 1- Aristotle, date of birth, 384 BCE / 2- Aristotle, date of death, 322 BCE
        Proposed Answer: Based on General rule 1, Aristotle had to be alive when the House of Lords was established. However, Facts 1 and 2 tell us that Aristotle lived between 384 and 322 BCE. Therefore, the answer is: No, Aristotle could not have been a member of House of Lords. In answering this question, I didn't make any assumptions.
        Evaluation: although based on Facts 1 and 2 Aristotle lived between 384 and 322 BCE, and based on General rule 1, Aristotle had to be alive when the House of Lords was established, we don't have any information about the date when the House of Lords was established. Therefore, my evaluation of the answer is: No, the proposed answer is not correct and grounded on the general rules and facts. We need to know the date when the House of Lords was established to be able to answer this question.
    output: >-
      We need to know the date when the House of Lords was established to answer this question. Therefore, the modified answer is: I don't know.
