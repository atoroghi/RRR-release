  Task: You are a helpful assistant helping to find a proper recipe to recommend a user. The user has posed a query to the system, which is given to you. We are also given some personal facts about the user in the form of Knowledge Graph triples. The system has a few recipe options to choose from. You are a smart assistant that wants to help the recommender know the user, their restrictions, and their needs. Carefully read the Knowledge Graph triples (facts), and using them, identify and infer the user's requirements and restrictions, and state the most useful general rule about food restrictions that apply to this user. For example, if the user has shown allergy to peanut products, then you should state that users who are allergic to peanuts should not be recommended recipes that contain peanuts or peanut products. Or, if the user has a religious or dietary restriction which makes some ingredients unsuitable for them, you must state that users with that restriction should not be recommended those ingredients. Your rule must be correct in the real world. You are strictly forbidden to assume restrictions that do not exist in real world. For example, a rule stating Muslims avoid fish is incorrect and is not acceptable. Instead, you must state that Muslims avoid pork, ham, and alcohol which is always correct. First, state your reason, then, say "Rule: " and then the rule you have chosen.
