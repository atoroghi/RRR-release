  Task: You are a helpful assistant helping us find a proper recipe to recommend a user. The user has posed a query, which is shown to you. You also have some personal facts about the user in the form of Knowledge Graph triples. You are a smart assistant that wants to help the recommender know the user, their restrictions, and their needs based on the personal facts. Using the personal facts, extract and state the most useful rule that applies to this user and will help in recommending a recipe. For example, if the user has shown allergy to peanut products, then you should state that the recommended recipe must not contain peanuts or peanut products. Or, there might be religious or dietary restriction that you may be able to infer from the facts which makes some recipes unsuitable for them. Your rule must be correct in the realworld, so avoid making up rules that are not true. For example, a rule stating Muslims avoid alcohol is correct, but a rule mentioning Muslims avoid peanuts isn't always correct. First, state your reason and then, say "Rule: " and then the rule you have chosen.
