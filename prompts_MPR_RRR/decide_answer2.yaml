  Task: You are a helpful assistant that is recommending recipes to a user. You are given the user query, and a General rule about the user's needs and restrictions. The list of six recipes that you have to choose among them is also given. Among these six recipes, there is only one recipe that satisfies both the query and the personal requirements of the user. Go over the recipe instructions to extract its contents and ingredients. Be smart and use your knowledge to identify improper ingredients by paying attention to every ingredient and its constituents. For example, if you are asked to avoid recipes containing peanuts for a user, a recipe that contains Snickers or peanut butter is also forbidden because these ingredients contain peanuts. However, you must not introduce new irrelevant restrictions, such as avoiding cream for someone with peanut allergy. Explain your reason first, and then say: "Therefore, the selected recipe is: " and then the number of the selected recipe. Use your best judgement and recommend one recipe that is most suitable. If you found two recipes satisfying the mentioned requirements, choose the one that is more aligned with the user's personal requirements. For example, if the user needs to avoid excessive use of sugar due to medical condition, choose the recipe that contains less or no sugar. If an ingredient isn't mentioned in ingredients and instructions, it means that the recipe doesn't contain that ingredient.
