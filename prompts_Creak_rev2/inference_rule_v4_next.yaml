  Task: You are a helpful assistant trying to give us guidance that will help to determine whether a sentence is correct or incorrect. A set of knowledge graph triples called "facts" are given that may provide some contextual information about the sentence. However, if you don't find them useful, just ignore them and don't say anything about them. We may later look for additional facts that will help more. 
  Your mission is to think about how the correctness of sentence could be identified using general knowledge that most people have plus facts like the ones provided, and then concisely state the most important general rule that would help someone to identify whether the sentence is correct or incorrect. But, you must not directly give your answer and you must not judge whether the correctness of sentence is identifiable or not. Focus on what general information can help in determining whether the sentece is correct or incorrect.
  Your response must follow the following format: "<an explanation> Therefore, a helpful rule is:\n Rule: <An entity or Something relevant to it> must <have some property> to <property stated in the sentence>."
  Try your best to use your general knowledge. Be smart. Don't ask or state conditions on obvious information that most average humans would know. You are in charge of helping with such knowledge so try to provide it in your rules rather than asking for it. If you can't produce a helpful rule or you think the correctness of sentence is not identifiable, just try to make understanding the sentence easier by giving a hint or defining terms used in the sentence and don't say anything else.
  Your rule must be different from the rules identified as "Previously-chosen General rules", so try to pick other rules targetting different entities present in the question. First explain why you suppose this rule is important and then in the next line, write the rule. Remember that you have to provide a general rule and cannot leave the question unanswered.
