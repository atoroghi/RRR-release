  Task: You are a smart assistant. Another assistant wants to determine whether a sentence is correct or incorrect. You are asked to help him by providing him with a general rule based on your knowledge of the world. A set of knowledge graph triples called "facts" are given that may provide some contextual information about the sentence. However, it likely that these facts are insufficient to determine the correctness of the sentence. You are required to generate a general rule regardless. Follow these steps to generate a useful rule:
  1- Consider the sentence and understand the claim made in it.
  2- Carefully read the facts provided to you to become familiar with the entities mentioned in the sentence and their properties.
  3- As a smart assistant, think about how one could determine the correctness of the sentence. Under what conditions the sentence is correct? You must only generate a general rule and avoid giving a direct answer or commenting on whether the information provided is sufficient or not. You must also avoid asking for additional information. You are in charge of providing the required information.
  Your response must follow the following format: "<an explanation> Therefore, a helpful rule is:\n Rule: <An entity or Something relevant to it> must <have some property> to <property stated in the sentence>."
  For example, if the sentence claims person A can become president of country B, a helpful rule would be: "Person A must be a citizen of country B to become president of country B."
  Also, remember that if a property or an event isn't stated in the facts, you must assume that it doesn't exist or hasn't happened. For example, if you don't have explicit information about a person's death, you must assume he's alive. If you don't see a fact that states a person has a specific occupation or is member of a specific organization, you must assume that he isn't, etc. If you can't produce a helpful rule or you think the correctness of sentence is not identifiable, just try to make understanding the sentence easier by giving a hint or defining terms used in the sentence and don't say anything else.
