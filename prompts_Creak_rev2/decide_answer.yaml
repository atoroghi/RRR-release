  Task: You are a helpful assistant that is trying to help us determine whether a sentence is correct or not. You are given the sentence, a number of general rules, and a list of knowledge graph triples which we call them facts that may be helpful. First, go over the facts and general rules one by one. Try to think of how each of them may help you. Then, if you don't have information about something or the general rule isn't helpful, as a smart assistant, try to use your general knowledge of the world and to find the answer. Be smart. Don't refrain from answering because you don't have information that a smart human could infer from the given facts. If a property or an event isn't stated in the facts, and a smart human couldn't infer it, you must assume that it doesn't exist or hasn't happened. For example, if you don't have explicit information about a person's death, you must assume he's alive. If you don't see a fact that states a person has a specific occupation or is member of a specific organization, you must assume that he isn't. 
  Your response must follow the following format:
  Answer: <your reason> Therefore, the answer is: <your final answer(beginning with "Yes", "No", or "I don't know")>
  You must begin your response with "Yes" if you have determined that the sentence is correct. Begin your response with "No" if you determined the sentence is incorrect. Try your best to give the an answer with your observations and reasonable assumptions, but if using the current set of general rules and facts is not enough even with plausible assumptions, in the beginning of your answer, you must only say "I don't know".

        Ali Asiaei was influenced by Hana Beizaei in his works.
        General rules: 1- The sentence claims that Ali Asiaei was influenced by Hana Beizaei in his works. Typically, a person can influence another person's works if they are both active in the same field.
        Facts: 1- (Ali Asiaei, is, Iranian director (1900-1950))
        2- (Ali Asiaei, instance of, human)
        3- (Ali Asiaei, occupation, director)
        4- (Ali Asiaei, country of citizenship, Iran)
        5- (Hana Beizaei, date of birth, 1951/12/26)
        6- (Hana Beizaei, father, Bahram Beizaie)
        7- (Hana Beizaei, occupation, director)
    output: |-
        Answer: General rule 1 tells us that a person can influence another person's works if they are both active in the same field. Fact 3 tells us that Ali Asiaei is a director. Fact 7 tells us that Hana Beizaei is also a director. However, the time they lived in is also important. Fact 1 tells us that Ali Asiaei died in 1950, but Fact 5 tells us that Hana Beizaei was born in 1951 which is after Ali Asiaei's death. Since Ali Asiaei died before Hana Beizaei's birth, he couldn't be influenced by her. Therefore, the answer is: No, Ali Asiaei was not influenced by Hana Beizaei in his works because he died before Hana Beizaei had done any work.

        General rules: 1- The sentence claims that Paolo Maldini and his predessor as the general manager of A.C. Milan come from the same country. Typically, people whose birthplaces are located in the same country are known to come from the same country.

    output: >-
        Answer: General rule 1 tells us that the birth places of Paolo Maldini and his predecessor in A.C. Milan must be located in the same country for the answer to be yes. Fact 2 tells us that Paolo Maldini's birth place is Milan which is located in Italy, and Fact 6 tells us that Paolo Maldini's predecessor was Marco Fassone, but it doesn't tell us where he was born. If we knew the birthplace of Marco Fassone, we could have answered the question, but we can't make any plausible assumption about Marco Fassone's birthplace. Therefore, the answer is: I don't know.

We know that typically, mechanics repair cars in their career. Fact 2 tells us that Walid Soliman is an association football player. Since we cannot infer from the facts that Walid Soliman is also a mechanic, we must assume that he isn't. Therefore, the answer is: No, Walid Soliman is not likely to have repaired several cars during his career.
