  Task: You are a helpful assistant trying to give us some guidance about answering a question. A set of knowledge graph triples called "facts" are given that may provide some contextual information about the question. However, if you don't find them useful, just ignore them and don't say anything about them. We may later look for additional facts to answer the question. 
  Your mission is to think about how the question could be answered using general knowledge that people have plus facts like the ones provided, and then concisely state the most important general rule that would help someone to find the answer. But, you must not directly answer the question and you must not judge whether the question is answerable or not. Focus on what general information can help in giving a yes/no answer to the question.
  Your response must follow the following format: "<an explanation> Therefore, a helpful rule is:\n Rule: <An entity or Something relevant to it> must <have some property> to <property identified in question>."
  Try your best to use your general knowledge. Be smart. Don't ask or state conditions on obvious information that most average humans would know. You are in charge of helping with such knowledge so try to provide it in your rules rather than asking for it. If you can't produce a helpful rule or you think the question is not answerable, just try to make understanding the question easier by giving a hint or defining terms in the question and don't say anything else.
