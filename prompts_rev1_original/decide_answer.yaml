  Task: You are a helpful assistant that is trying to help us answer a question. You are given the question, a number of general rules, and a list of knowledge graph triples which we call them facts that may be helpful in finding the answer. First, go over the facts and general rules one by one. Try to think of how each fact may help you answer the question. Then, if you don't have explicit information about something or the general rule isn't helpful, try to use your general knowledge of the world and make plausible assumptions to find the answer. Be smart. Don't ask for obvious information that most average humans would know.
  Your response must follow the following format:
  Answer: <your reason> Therefore, the answer is: <your final answer(beginning with "Yes", "No", or "I don't know")>
  You must only begin your response with "Yes" or "No" if you want to give the answer to the question. Try your best to use facts, general rules, and plausible assumptions to give the answer. If using the current set of general rules and facts is not enough to answer the question even with plausible assumptions, in the beginning of your answer, you must only say "I don't know".

        Answer: General rule 1 tells us that Georgios Koutsias's father must have been alive during the time the House of Lords existed and be a United Kingdom citizen. Fact 4 tells us that Georgios Koutsias's father is Nikolas Koutsias. Fact 8 tells us that House of Lords existed since 1801, and Fact 6 tells us that Nikolas Koutsias was born in 1964. However, Fact 5 tells us that Nikolas Koutsias is a citizen of Greece, not the United Kingdom.

    output: >-
        Answer: Based on General rule 1, the birth places of Paolo Maldini and his predecessor in A.C. Milan must be located in the same country for the answer to be yes. Fact 2 tells us that Paolo Maldini's birth place is Milan which is located in Italy, and Fact 6 tells us that Paolo Maldini's predecessor was Marco Fassone, but it doesn't tell us where he was born. If we knew the birthplace of Marco Fassone, we could have answered the question, but we can't make any plausible assumption about Marco Fassone's birthplace. Therefore, the answer is: I don't know.

      QUESTION: |-
        Could a Pirouz fit in an Airbus A330?
        General rules: 1- The question asks us to judge about the possibility of fitting Pirouz in an Airbus A330. We need to know the dimensions of a Pirouz and dimensions of an Airbus A330 to answer the question.
        Facts: 1- Pirouz, instance of, Persian Leopard
        2- Pirouz, date of birth, 2010
        3- Persian Leopard, instance of, mammal
        4- Persian Leopard, taxon name, Panthera pardus tulliana
        5- Persian Leopard, subclass of, leopard
        6- Airbus A330, instance of, wide-body aircraft
        7- Airbus A330, manufacturer, Airbus
        8- Airbus A330, has use, commercial aviation
    output: >-
        Answer: The general rule doesn't provide explicit information about how we can decide whether pirouz would fit in an Airbus A330 or not. However, we can use our general knowledge. We know that dimensions of an object must be smaller than the dimensions of the other object to fit in it. Fact 1 tells us that Pirouz is a Persian Leopard and Fact 3 tells us that a Persian Leopard is a mammal and Fact 6 tells us that Airbus A330 is a wide-body aircraft. Although the facts don't provide explicit information about the dimensions of Pirouz and Airbus A330, we are allowed to make plausible assumptions based on general knowledge. We know that typically, leopards are much smaller than aircrafts. So, it is plausible to assume that the dimensions of Pirouz are considerably smaller than the dimensions of Airbus A330. Therefore, the answer is: Yes, Pirouz can fit in an Airbus A330.
