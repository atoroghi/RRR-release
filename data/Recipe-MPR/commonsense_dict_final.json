        "instructions": "1- Step 1: Have the butcher separate the pork hock bones.\n2- Step 2: Rinse well in running water to wash off blood.\n3- Boil in large pot for 15 minutes.\n4- You want to barely cover the bones with water.\n5- Step 3: Skim off as much scum as possible as it forms.\n6- Step 4: Drain in colander and use a brush to remove any bloody meat.\n7- Step 5: Use a saw and saw halfway down the center of the bones.\n8- Then use hammer to break bone.\n9- Note: I didnt have to break the bones since my butchers pork hocks already had the marrow exposed.\n10- Step 6: The bones will be filled with marrow.\n11- Simmer for several hours until the marrow dissolves out from the bones.\n12- Step 7: Scum will form at the start.\n13- Carefully skim the scum off.\n14- On mid flame, maintain a low boil.\n15- Step 8: After scum has stopped forming, simmer for 6 hours or more.\n16- Add more water if the water level drops.\n17- Step 9: Making the noodles.\n18- After measuring out the ingredients, mix the flour and kansui together, then add the water.\n19- It may feel as if the amount of water is insufficient.\n20- This is normal.\n21- Step 10: Mix in bowl until a mealy consistency is achieved.\n22- Step 11: The dough will be very stiff.\n23- Use you body weight to form the dough into a ball.\n24- Step 12: Transfer to kneading surface and knead.\n25- Knead vigorously for 10 minutes.\n26- It is ok if the dough cracks or does not knead together well.\n27- Step 13: Form into ball, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.\n28- Make sure that the dough does not dry out.\n29- Step 14: While the dough rests, prepare the char siu.\n30- Brown the meat in a pan and then simmer in a pot for 2 hours in a sauce made from the remaining ingredients.\n31- Allow to cool in the pot.\n32- Step 15: After the dough has rested, roll the dough out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 5 mm and then insert into pasta machine.\n33- Start out with the highest thickness and then continue on the lower settings until the desired thickness is achieved.\n34- Step 16: If a pasta machine is not used, roll out the dough to the desired thickness with the rolling pin.\n35- Take into account that the noodles will expand 1.3 times when boiled.\n36- Step 17: The dough will not be that sticky, so a small amount of flour or potato (or corn) starch is sufficient for flouring.\n37- (Note that the recipe only shows the noodles being cut by a pasta machine and does not mention hand cutting).\n38- Step 18: A wooden box is best for storing the noodles, but if one is not available, use a metal tray lined with wax paper (to prevent sticking) and store in the refrigerator.\n39- Step 19: 2 hours after the pork bones have started simmering, the soup should become progressively white and cloudy.\n40- If tasted at this stage, the soup will not taste good since it will still have a raw flavor.\n41- Step 20: After the soup has simmered for 6 hours, The inside of the bones should now be empty and the soup should have a rich smell just like a ramen place.\n42- The stock is rich.\n43- It exactly like the picture, its not a clear stock at all.\n44- Just remember that it wont have much taste right now because theres no salt.\n45- But dont adjust the seasoning until the end of the recipe because youre adding soy sauce to the ramen base.\n46- Step 21: The char siu should be a nice amber color.\n47- Slice with care since it will be very tender and tend to fall apart.\n48- Step 22: Any leftovers can be eaten with beer.\n49- LOL But I will add that if you ever have trouble slicing soft pork, chill the whole piece in the refrigerator until cold, and it makes slicing easier.\n50- Reheating is easy, in either the microwave or oven, even stove top.\n51- Step 23: Its time to put everything together.\n52- Since boiling time can differ, boil the noodles to each persons preference.\n53- For people who like curly noodles, firmly squeeze the noodles until the desired effect is achieved.\n54- Step 24: Warm the bowl, and add the char siu sauce and salt for flavor.\n55- Use sparingly at first and then add more if desired.\n56- Step 25: I prefer to boil the noodles for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.\n57- Your rich and hearty tonkotsu ramen is complete.\n58- Notes:.\n59- Okay, because final assembly occurred, I prepared some soy sauce marinated eggs the night before.\n60- Heres what I did:.\n61- Ingredients:.\n62- 12 eggs in shells.\n63- Diced pork hock meat (leftovers from recipe above) 1 lb.\n64- 3 green onions cut into 1 inch pieces.\n65- 1 thumb sized piece of ginger sliced.\n66- 2 large cloves of garlic sliced.\n67- 1/2 cup soy sauce.\n68- 2 Tablespoons cooking wine/sake/sherry.\n69- 2 Tablespoons Sugar.\n70- 1/2 cup water.\n71- Step 1: Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil.\n72- (Using a small thumb tack, I prick a pin hole in the base (fat end) of every egg, but thats not necessary.)\n73- The the water is at a full boil, I put the eggs inches The water should cover the eggs.\n74- Wait for the water to come back to a full boil, and time for 7 minutes.\n75- (9 minutes will give you a fully hard boiled egg.\n76- 7 minutes is a very soft boiled egg.)\n77- Drain the pot and eggs and plunge the eggs in ice water to stop cooking.\n78- This also makes the shells a bit easier to peel.\n79- Step 2: In a small pot, saute pork, garlic, onions, and ginger until slightly browned.\n80- Add soy sauce, cooking alcohol, sugar, water and simmer for 10 minutes.\n81- Until pork is cooked through and flavors meld.\n82- Remove from stove.\n83- Remove pork to eat separately.\n84- Pour everything else into a bowl large enough to hold marinade and eggs.\n85- Step 3: Carefully, peel the eggs, and place in marinade.\n86- Try to make sure the marinade covers all of the eggs.\n87- If not, try transferring the sauce into a large ZipLock bag, and place the eggs in the bag and seal.\n88- Place the bag in a bowl, and put everything in the refrigerator overnight.\n89- Or at least for a few hours.\n90- Soy sauce eggs ready!\n91- I usually cut them in half before adding them to the ramen bowl.\n92- You can reheat the eggs quickly in the stock before you assemble the ramen.\n"
