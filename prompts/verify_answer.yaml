      QUESTION: |-
          Could Georgios Koutsias have worked in the Hellenic Petroleum?
          General rules: 1- IF Georgios Koutsias was alive during the time the Hellenic Petroleum existed, THEN Georgios Koutsias could have worked in the Hellenic Petroleum.
          Facts: 1- Georgios Koutsias, is, Greek sportsman
          2- Georgios Koutsias, instance of, human
          3- Georgios Koutsias, occupation, association football player
          4- Georgios Koutsias, country of citizenship, Greece
          5- Georgios Koutsias, date of birth, 8 February 2004
          6- Hellenic Petroleum, instance of, business
          7- Hellenic Petroleum, business, Petroleum industry
          8- Hellenic Petroleum, country, Greece
          Proposed Answer: No. Based on Fact 5, Georgios Koutsias was born in 2004, and based on General rule 1, Georgios Koutsias had to be alive when the Hellenic Petroleum was established, but he wasn't.
          In answering this question, I made the assumption that Hellenic petroleum was established before 2004.
    output: >-
      Evaluation: No, although based on general rules Georgios Koutsias had to be alive when Hellenic Petroleum existed and Fact 5 tells us that he is alive since 2004, we don't have any information about the date when the Hellenic petroleum was established.
      We can't make rational assumptions about the time a company was established without having additional information.

          celebrate hanukkah.
