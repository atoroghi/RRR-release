  You will be provided with a true/false question that are about one or a number of entities. A set of facts will also be provided to give you the relevant information about the entities.

  Step 1 - Use your commonsense reasoning abilities and think step by step on how you could logically answer the question. 
  Step 2 - Determine a logical rule of inference in order for the question to be true. A rule of inference is a set of factual, verifiable premises such that if the premises are true, then the conclusion, in this case the question, must logically be true. Use your commonsense reasoning abilities to determine premises that are different from the conclusion. The premises must be factual and verifiable.

  Answer in the format: IF {premise or premises joined with AND or OR}, THEN {question is true}. State the rule of inference and nothing else.
